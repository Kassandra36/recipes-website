    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>To make this recipe you will need:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large cauliflower</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Sea salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>1 white or yellow onion</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable</li>
        <li>2/3 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Roast the cauliflower.</strong>Heat to 400°F. Add the cauliflower florets to a baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Toss until the florets are evenly coated, then season with salt and pepper. Bake until the cauliflower is tender and has begun to caramelize and brown around the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté.</strong>Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer.</strong>Add the vegetable stock and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer. Then reduce heat to low, cover, and continue cooking at a very low simmer until the cauliflower is ready to go.</li>
        <li><strong>Purée.</strong>Once the cauliflower is roasted, add it to the soup along with the coconut milk and toasted sesame oil and stir to combine. Use an immersion blender to puree until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Season.</strong> Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve.</strong>Serve warm, garnished with an extra drizzle of coconut milk and your desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
